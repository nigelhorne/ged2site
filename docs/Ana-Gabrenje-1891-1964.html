Ana became pregnant with Amalja, but Valentine left for America before his daughter was born. He promised to send for her, but he never did. Eventually when Amalja was 13, she found her own way to America. We are not sure if she gotten him to send the money or how she did it. She did leave behind her house and let her sister move into it. From papers my uncle has given me, I have learned that the house was very basic with no plumbing or heating. Eventually the family spent a lot of money to add these things as well as a new roof and other improvements. They also paid the taxes and eventually the house became theirs. The family member who owned the house in when a contract was written sometime before Valentine died, was Mateja Homovec (nee Zgonc). Today telephone records in Slovenia list a Milos Homovec living in the house. I am guessing that Ana&#39;s sister married a Mr. Zgonc and her daughter or granddaughter was Mateja who married a Mr. Homovec. I have contacted a Liydia Homovec via Facebook and if that doesn&#39;t pan out, I will send Milos as snail-mail letter. I hope to be able to meet this previously unknown branch of my family tree this summer.</p><h2>Family Tree</h2><img src="img/I_2072090351.png" width="293" height="267" usemap="#family" alt="Family Tree"><map id="family" name="family"><area shape="rect" id="node1" href="Anton-Gabrenje-1873.html" title="Anton Gabrenje\nb. 1873" alt="" coords="45,5,155,53"/><area shape="rect" id="node2" href="Ana-Gabrenje-1891-1964.html" title="Ana Gabrenje\nb.
